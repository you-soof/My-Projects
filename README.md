Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a diverse collection of projects that bridge the worlds of design and technologyâ€”from BIM-driven computational design, immersive AR/VR experiences, and Unity games, to innovative software development in Python (including ML and DL), mobile app development, and web development. This space reflects my passion for integrating digital tools into creative solutions across architecture, smart cities, and interactive media.
